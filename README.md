# **Fundamentals of a photograph's exposure**


# **Aperture**
* Represented by an f-number (e.g., f/2.8, f/5.6, f/16).
* A wide aperture (smaller f-number) allows more light to enter and produces a shallow depth of field with a blurred background.
* A narrow aperture (larger f-number) restricts the amount of light and increases the depth of field, resulting in more of the scene being in focus.


# **Shutter Speed**
* Measured in seconds or fractions of a second (e.g., 1/1000s, 1/250s, 1s).
* A fast shutter speed (e.g., 1/1000s) restricts the amount of light and allows for freezing fast-moving subjects.
* A slow shutter speed (e.g., 1s) allows more light to enter and capturing motion blur.


# **ISO**
* Represented by a numerical value (e.g., ISO 100, ISO 400, ISO 3200).
* A lower ISO setting (e.g., ISO 100) is less sensitive to light and is typically used in bright lighting conditions.
* A higher ISO setting (e.g., ISO 1600) makes the sensor more sensitive, allowing for photography in low-light situations. However, increasing the ISO can introduce digital noise or graininess into the image.













First cylinder length = 23 cm × 2
                                    = 46 cm

Second cylinder detracted = 4.5 cm × 2
                                               = 9 cm

Current second cylinder length = 46 - 9
                                                       = 37 cm


New first cylinder length = 46 - 14
                                            = 32 cm

New second cylinder length = 37 - 14
                                                  = 23 cm
